# HazDane
Image ML Recognition to determine if a photo contains a Great Dane
- This is not a perfect project by any means, but it's a fun experiment and got my machine CUDA enabled, as well as some fun practice tinkering with NN models
- A selection of photos from the tensorflow flowers classification tutorial were used in the not-dane class. The license is retained in this project to cite the contributing authors


# This project originally required that I had a full data harvest for all of the saved reddit posts on my user account.
- Those files were lost in a freak git accident :)
- I still have the Auth File, but lost the flask app. I may recreate those in the future because it was a neat experiment
- They weren't exactly pivotal to the NN project repo, which is this one
- I still have the url list of downloadable images, and will have the photos supplied again shortly
